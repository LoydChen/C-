Lost Stars
		歌手：Adam Levine
Please don't see 
只是 求你
Just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies 
别只看到那个我 沉沦在虚无梦想里
Please see me 
真的 求你
Reaching out for someone I can't see 
试着触碰 被我深藏着的自己
Take my hand, let's see where we wake up tomorrow 
牵起我手 一同守着 你我一同醒来的时候
Best laid plans sometimes are just one night stand 
再多准备 有时却只换得 一夜相拥的遗憾
I'll be damned, Cupid's demanding back his arrow 
眼睁睁 看着召回爱情的诅咒
So let's get drunk on our tears and... 
那就痛饮吧 混着泪水 醉倒在地
God, tell us the reason 
神啊 究竟为什么！
Youth is wasted on the young 
青春总荒废于虚妄
It's hunting season 
像在狩猎的季节
And the lambs are on the run 
我们的爱只能步步紧逼 若惊慌羔羊
Searching for the meaning 
寻找着的意义
But are we all lost stars 
我们都是 迷茫的星星
Trying to light up the dark 
竭力将周围虚空点亮
 
Who are we 
我们 是谁？
Just a speck of dust within the galaxy 
不过茫茫夜空中 一点星尘
Woe is me 
稍不小心
if we're not careful turns into reality 
甜蜜的梦 便被坠落在地
But don't you dare let our best memories bring you sorrow 
试着找回 你我当年最美的回忆 来冲淡你的伤痛
Yesterday I saw a lion kiss a deer 
昨日 我见到雄狮轻吻着小鹿
Turn the page maybe we'll find a brand new ending 
爱转角 也许会有个全新的结局
Where we're dancing in our tears 
透过泪光 看到我们相拥而舞
And god, tell us the reason 
神啊 究竟是为什么
Youth is wasted on the young 
年少轻狂总辜负时光
It's hunting season 
在这狩猎季节
And the lambs are on the run 
连爱都要如此匆忙
Searching for the meaning 
寻不到意义
But are we all lost stars 
我们都是 迷茫的星星
Trying to light up the dark 
只想竭力照亮彼此罢了
 
 
I thought I saw you out there crying 
还以为 看到你在角落痛哭的幻影
I thought I heard you call my name 
还以为 听到你正心碎着呢喃我名
I thought I heard you out there crying 
脑海中似看到你失声痛哭的背影
But just the same 
只若当年
 
 
And god, give us the reason 
神啊 究竟是为什么
Youth is wasted on the young 
青春总荒废于虚妄
It's hunting season 
在这残酷的时候
And this lamb is on the run 
连爱都要如此匆忙
Searching for the meaning 
一路寻不到意义
But are we all lost stars 
我们都是 迷茫的星星
Trying to light up the dark 
只想竭力照亮彼此罢了
 
I thought I saw you out there crying 
还以为 看到你在角落痛哭的幻影
I thought I heard you call my name 
还以为 听到你正流着泪呼唤我名
I thought I heard you out there crying 
脑海中看到你失声痛哭的背影
But are we all lost stars 
我们都迷失了自己
Trying to light up the dark 
在孤独中痛苦挣扎
But are we all lost stars 
我们都是迷茫的星星
Trying to light up the dark 
用最后一点星光拼命挣扎
